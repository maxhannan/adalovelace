            Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace<br>
            (10 December 1815 â€“ 27 November 1852)<br>
            was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on 
            harles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, 
            the Analytical Engine. She is believed by some to be the first to recognise 
            that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published 
            the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, 
            she is often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of computers 
            and as one of the first computer programmers.
